        <h2>A. User Experience Requirements</h2>
	    <h3><b>User Stories</b></h3>

	    <ol class="secondList">
		    <li>1. As a student with color blindness, I want to be able to customize the color and font on my exam screen, so that I am able to properly comprehend the images and information the text conveys.</li>
            <p class="shifted">In a study conducted by Colour Blind Awareness, 4.5% of the population is colorblind [1]. Because of the smaller number, many designers tend to not be color blind and therefore don’t accommodate this minority population of people. We want to ensure that our proctoring software focuses on these individuals by allowing them to customize the background and font colors/type to their own liking and what they are comfortable with. </p>
            <p class="shifted">Silver, Adam, et al. “Improving the Color Accessibility for Color-Blind Users.” Smashing Magazine, 21 June 2016, https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/improving-color-accessibility-for-color-blind-users/. </p>
            <br>
            <li>2. As a student with dyslexia, I want to be able to increase the font size and spacing of text questions, so that I am able to navigate the exam at the same level as someone without dyslexia.</li>
		    <p>A study conducted by a group of people from the University of Genoa studied the effects of font sizes and spaces on the efficiency of dyslexic students reading text. The study found that there was significant reduction of the time both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children remained fixated on certain pieces of texts [2]. Based on this study, we wanted to ensure that our proctoring service accommodated any students who may have dyslexia by allowing them to customize the font size and spacing of their exam questions prior to and during an exam. </p>                
            <p class="shifted">Masulli, Francisco. “Effect of Different Font Sizes and of Spaces between Words on Eye Movement Performance: An Eye Tracker Study in Dyslexic and Non-Dyslexic Children.” Vision Research, Pergamon, 9 Oct. 2018, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698918302074. </p>
            <br>
            <li>3. As a student with anxiety, I want to view clear feedback and instructions, so that I am assured of my status during the exam, and so that I conduct myself within the expectations of the audio and visual monitoring.</li>
		    <p>There are times when sounds may occur in the background that get caught in the microphone so in order to prevent unfair flagging for cheating, the features such as the visual monitoring option and audio setting operation help prevent that potentially [5].</p>

            <br>
            <li>4. As a student with a visual impairment, I want to be able to customize the contrast and brightness of my screen, so that I do not face any challenges with the visual setup of my exam’s content.</li>
		    <p>Research shows that many students with visual impairments generally need questions on the screen presented in high contrast to see everything clearly [3]. Also, depending on each person’s need, they may need additional or reduced lighting to allow for them to see clearly [4]. Because of these factors, our site allows for a customization of the contrast and brightness of the screen so that students can adjust the exam software to a way that can benefit them personally. </p>

            <br>
            <li>5. As a student with ADHD, I want to be able to customize the layout of test questions, so that I can focus on one question at a time, rather than being distracted by the following question text.</li>
		    <p>If a student has ADHD or another learning disability, then certain proctoring software is flagging them for cheating because they are looking away from their screens [4].  Due to this bias, we wanted to implement this design feature so that it is customizable to them.</p>
            <br>
            <li>6. As a student of color, I want access to the camera brightness and contrast settings, so that during the pre-check process I can avoid being flagged or facing any other issues. </li>
            <p class="shifted">Proctoring software often has a difficult time detecting darker skin tones. For example, according to research, Proctorio neglected to detect darker skin tones more than 50% of the time [3]. Over time, this behavior could incur a bias which negatively impacts the students and does not make their test taking process easy.[1]</p>
            <br>
            <li>7. As a student with a hearing impairment, I want an icon that allows me to access a text-to-speech tool, so that I can select text and have it read out loud to me.</li>
		    <br>
            <li>8. As a student, I would like to be able to access different screen customizations, so that I can take my exam in a manner efficient to me.</li>
            <br>
            <li>9. As a student from a non-english background, I want access to an in-built tool that can translate words for me, so that I am able to comprehend words in the exam context if anything becomes confusing for me.</li>
		    <br>
            <li>10. As an educator, I want to be able to adjust my exam and activate/deactivate certain customizable features, so that my exam is taken where no one student has a clear advantage over another.</li>
	    </ol>    

        <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The most relevant user stories are those that fall within 1) Picture/Screen, and 2) Testing Operations. Based on our proposal, we want to prioritize changes toward user accessibility, screen customization, and testing experience. 
            Addressing these specific user stories will allow us to flesh out which design choices we believe will help mitigate these issues for users. These user stories address users with disabilities, learning differences, and varying skin tones.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>B. Ideation and Preliminary Designs</h2>

    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">While discussing our ten user stories, we decided to group them into four categories: Picture/Screen, Testing Operations, Language/Speech, and Educator's Perspective.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="user1.png" alt="User Story 1" style="width:60%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="user12.png" alt="User Story 2" style="width:60%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="user3.png" alt="User Story 3" style="width:60%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <img src="user4.png" alt="User Story 4" style="width:60%">
          </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Picture/Screen</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Our top design choice for this section was allowing various customizable colors that associate with different feelings because we have found that allowing students to choose their own preferred colors can help them feel more comfortable in the testing environment. 
        <br>Adding a dark mode and light mode feature is helpful and is our second choice because studies have shown that dark mode can help keep up battery life and reduce eye strain which is beneficial especially for exams that are very long. 
        </p>
      
      <h3>Testing Operations</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Our top design choice for this section would be the feature to auto-adjust the webcam brightness because this will help mitigate the unnecessary flagging for people with darker skin tones. With this feature, they will be able to adjust the brightness of their camera to their discretion. 
        <br> Our second favorite design choice would be the feature that allows how many questions are shown on a screen at one time. This feature allows the user to adjust the spacing of the questions so that they can customize to their comfort level.
        </p>
        <h3>Language/Speech</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Our top design choice is the sidebar navigation tool. This would ensure a smaller use of the screen. It would also be easily accessible for users. Users would be able to quickly move the tool if needed. Once an option is clicked, the tool would expand, making use of more space.
        <br>Our second choice is the pop-up window. Having access to the original and translated text would allow for convenient comparison and understanding for the user. This is our second choice due to the fact that an additional window may be distracting for some users.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Educator's Perspective</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Our favorite alternative design solution here is the ability for the educator to adjust student customization how they see fit for the exam. If the teacher doesn’t want a certain customization that he/she believes will give one student an advantage over another, they can disable that option.
        <br>Our second favorite design solution here is the ability to adjust the exam itself in real time. For example, if a teacher needs to put in a hint or a clarification for a specific question, a pop-up will come up telling the student what the teacher would like to say in real-time while the exam is happening. 
        </p>

<h3>Initial Wireframe Sketch</h3>
        <p>We began with an initial sketch. We discussed how current proctoring software looks and how we might want to change it. Making quick notes, we came up with a high-level view of the tabular design we wanted to pursue.</p>
