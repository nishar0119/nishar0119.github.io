	    <h3><b>User Stories</b></h3>
	    
	     <li>1. As a student with color blindness, I want to be able to customize the color and font on my exam screen, so that I am able to properly comprehend the images and information the text conveys.</li>
	    
		    <p class="shifted">
			    In a study conducted by Colour Blind Awareness, 4.5% of the population is colorblind [1]. Because of the smaller number, many designers tend to not be color blind and therefore don’t accommodate this
			    minority population of people. We want to ensure that our proctoring software focuses on these individuals by allowing them to customize the background and font colors/type to their own liking and 
			    what they are comfortable with. In our prototype we provided a section for font specific changes. One of the options we included for the font category was the ability for the student to choose what 
			    font color they would like. The reason we gave color as an option was because research shows that colors can affect the moods of every student differently and a page with color can hold a user’s 
			    attention a lot more than just gray and white colors could [2]. Also, the reason we chose to add the design element of blue hues throughout our website prototype is because many researchers have seen 
			    that blue is a favorite among people with color blindness. Blue and another color, Red, are known as “color blind safe colors” [3].

	    <li>2. As a student with dyslexia, I want to be able to increase the font size and spacing of text questions, so that I am able to navigate the exam at the same level as someone without dyslexia.</li>
	    		
	    		<p class="shifted">
				A study conducted by a group of people from the University of Genoa studied the effects of font sizes and spaces on the efficiency of dyslexic students reading text. The study found that there was 
				significant reduction of the time both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children remained fixated on certain pieces of texts [1]. Based on this study, we wanted to ensure that our proctoring service accommodated 
				any students who may have dyslexia by allowing them to customize the font size and spacing of their exam questions prior to and during an exam. Our current prototype includes a slider under the font 
				sub-category that allows the user to change up how big or small they would like their particular font to be. Research has found that along with reading words, dyslexic students also have trouble “reading 
				names of numbers [2]”. That is why we chose to add the design element of a range slider instead of other methods of choosing a font size. A slider allows a user to easily move back and forth between how large 
				or small their font is, without having to read any number.

	 <li>4. As a student with a visual impairment, I want to be able to customize the contrast and brightness of my screen, so that I do not face any challenges with the visual setup of my exam’s content.</li>
		  <p class="shifted">
			   Research shows that many students with visual impairments generally need questions on the screen presented in high contrast to see everything clearly [1]. Also, depending on each person’s need, they may 
			  need additional or reduced lighting to allow for them to see clearly [2]. Because of these factors, our site allows for a customization of the contrast and brightness of the screen so that students can adjust 
			  the exam software to a way that can benefit them personally. In our prototype, we add the design element Contrast, to allow the user to exercise that ability. Moving the slider allows for the user to build up the 
			  contrast, and we made sure to provide enough range so that users with heavy impairment can have a 7:1 contrast ratio [3].
