	    <h3><b>User Stories</b></h3>
	    
	     <li>1. As a student with color blindness, I want to be able to customize the color and font on my exam screen, so that I am able to properly comprehend the images and information the text conveys.</li>
	    
		    <p class="shifted">
			    In a study conducted by Colour Blind Awareness, 4.5% of the population is colorblind [1]. Because of the smaller number, many designers tend to not be color blind and therefore don’t accommodate this
			    minority population of people. We want to ensure that our proctoring software focuses on these individuals by allowing them to customize the background and font colors/type to their own liking and 
			    what they are comfortable with. In our prototype we provided a section for font specific changes. One of the options we included for the font category was the ability for the student to choose what 
			    font color they would like. The reason we gave color as an option was because research shows that colors can affect the moods of every student differently and a page with color can hold a user’s 
			    attention a lot more than just gray and white colors could [2]. Also, the reason we chose to add the design element of blue hues throughout our website prototype is because many researchers have seen 
			    that blue is a favorite among people with color blindness. Blue and another color, Red, are known as “color blind safe colors” [3].

	    		<p class="shifted">
				A study conducted by a group of people from the University of Genoa studied the effects of font sizes and spaces on the efficiency of dyslexic students reading text. The study found that there was 
				significant reduction of the time both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children remained fixated on certain pieces of texts [1]. Based on this study, we wanted to ensure that our proctoring service accommodated 
				any students who may have dyslexia by allowing them to customize the font size and spacing of their exam questions prior to and during an exam. Our current prototype includes a slider under the font 
				sub-category that allows the user to change up how big or small they would like their particular font to be. Research has found that along with reading words, dyslexic students also have trouble “reading 
				names of numbers [2]”. That is why we chose to add the design element of a range slider instead of other methods of choosing a font size. A slider allows a user to easily move back and forth between how large 
				or small their font is, without having to read any number.

	 <li>3. As a student with a visual impairment, I want to be able to customize the contrast and brightness of my screen, so that I do not face any challenges with the visual setup of my exam’s content.</li>
		  <p class="shifted">
			   Research shows that many students with visual impairments generally need questions on the screen presented in high contrast to see everything clearly [1]. Also, depending on each person’s need, they may 
			  need additional or reduced lighting to allow for them to see clearly [2]. Because of these factors, our site allows for a customization of the contrast and brightness of the screen so that students can adjust 
			  the exam software to a way that can benefit them personally. In our prototype, we add the design element Contrast, to allow the user to exercise that ability. Moving the slider allows for the user to build up the 
			  contrast, and we made sure to provide enough range so that users with heavy impairment can have a 7:1 contrast ratio [3].

		<li>4. As a student with ADHD, I want to be able to customize the layout of test questions, so that I can focus on one question at a time, rather than being distracted by the following question text.</li>
	     <p class="shifted">
		     Once a student gets to the setting page, they can click on one of the options on the right side and bring up the contents of that option they chose. As mentioned in the previous wire frames, blue was chosen in order to instill calmness and peace for the user to have a more pleasant test taking experience. In this wire frame, the highlighted selection produces the question spacing selection. This feature allows the user to choose and adjust the spacing of their questions. This page also included a display below that shows an example spacing of the questions and how it would look like when taking an exam.  This feature was created in mind for people with ADHD and other learning disabilities because research shows that proctoring software has a bias towards people with a learning disability because they tend to look off the screen so it unfairly flags them. The students from the Miami University in Ohio stated that Proctorio, the proctoring software they were using was unfairly accusing those with ADHD of cheating due to students looking away from the screen [1]. Tips for teachers for students with ADHD include not having too many questions on one screen or sheet of paper indicating that having a feature that allows the student to change the spacing between questions helps those with ADHD concentrate more [2].

	    <li>5. As a student of color, I want access to the camera brightness and contrast settings, so that during the pre-check process I can avoid being flagged or facing any other issues.</li>
	    <p class="shifted">The settings page is a location that contains a lot of options relevant to the changes we are trying to implement in our proctoring services. The reason why we wanted to implement these features such as webcam contrast is to make sure that people with all skin tones are treated fairly by the proctoring software and won’t get unfairly flagged. According to multiple reports, many students of color are getting unfairly flagged for the color of their skin not being picked up by the camera and thus leading them to get flagged or impeding their test taking experience. As mentioned before, the contrast feature will allow the student to be able to adjust the brightness/contrast of their camera to avoid unfair flagging.

	    <li>7. As a student with a hearing or visual impairment, I want an icon that allows me to access a text-to-speech tool, so that I can select text and have it read out loud to me.</li>
		    <p class="shifted">Those with reading disabilities, which may present themselves through an impairment of a sense, are positively impacted from the use of text-to-speech tools [1]. According to the findings by Wood et al., a statistically significant probability was found for an increase in comprehension through text-to-speech tools. Incorporated into our Language/Speech settings is a toolbar inspired by the ReadSpeaker platform [2]. Taking inspiration from their solution design, we chose to incorporate certain features that would allow the user to control their exam experience. Features incorporated include volume adjustment, speed adjustment, and forward/backward controls. This user story in relation to our problem of study addresses a subset of users who may face certain issues with simply reading exam text. If a user faces issues regarding reading, hearing, or visual impairments to any degree, this tool will aid them in having text read-aloud to them. By catering to the user experience, the prevalence of systemic issues can be avoided, while providing the greatest accessibility for everyone equally.

	    <li>8. As a student from a non-english speaking background, I want access to an in-built tool that can translate words for me, so that I am able to comprehend words in the exam context if anything becomes confusing for me.</li>
		     <p class="shifted">Students from a non-english speaking background may have difficulty in comprehending exam text. To address this user story, the Language/Speech options provide a tool, much like the platform QuestionMark does, to address users’ desire to translate text [1]. In addition, if users would like to translate text to their preferred language, as well as have the translated text read-aloud to them, the text-to-speech options will become available to them in the same side-bar. Keeping the exam time in mind, efficiency as a design choice was weighed heavily here. According to Garett et al., efficiency ranks as one of the top design elements in website design [2]. Keeping both options for translation close to one another allows for ease of use when interacting with the sidebar [3]. The drop-down component used in the Language/Speech features is being used according to the terms set by Fair Use and CC by 4.0. It is atrribtuted accordingly at the bottom of this milestone page.

	    <li>9. As an educator, I want to be able to adjust my exam and activate/deactivate certain customizable features, so that my exam is taken where no one student has a clear advantage over another.</li>
		    <p class="shifted">Our entire software revolves around ensuring regular students and students with disabilities (i.e. dyslexia, speech impairment, etc.) have a proper and fair exam environment that will accommodate any one of their needs. However, proctoring software needs to ensure that students have a fair testing environment without giving certain student’s advantages depending on the types of customizations they’re using. For example, if a student is taking a Spanish exam, they shouldn’t be allowed to use the translation feature since it would give them an unfair advantage in the exam. We want to keep the teacher in control since it still is a proctoring software, and the teacher should have the final say in which customizations are allowed and which aren’t for their specific exams (customizations should never give any student an unfair advantage). As a result, we put in the “Adjust Student Customizations” feature to allow teachers to have the final say in whether certain customizations are allowed or not allowed for their exams. Another feature we wanted to add was the teacher being able to adjust the exam during the time. For example, if the teacher makes a typo or there’s a specific hint he/she needs to give to the students to help them out, they’re able to do that in the “Adjust Exams” setting. 
		    </p>
		      <p class="shifted">The educator should be able to quickly and easily change student customizations or adjust the exam so that the exam stays as current as possible. Therefore, we needed to make sure that the icons used are easily recognizable and the layout of the entire settings page is easy to navigate [1] [2]. To ensure this, we used several icons that match perfectly with what specific setting the educator is adjusting. For example, we used an icon that had a test paper and pencil to signify the “Adjust Exam” setting. We hope that the icon serves as a proper signifier that this option affords adjusting the exams the teacher has [1]. Another example is the hint icon. We used a person with a question mark to signify a hint button [1].

	    <h2>B. Testing Protocol</h2>
	    <br>
	     <h3><b>Research Question and Methodology</b></h3>
	    <p class="shifted">Our research question is to what extent does adding accessibility features to testing software impact a user’s test taking experience? This research question provides us 
		with an ample amount of room to determine what type of effects may result from added features for a user during a proctored exam.
		The testing protocols we have chosen to use to address this research question are interviews and observation.
	    </p>
    
	    <br>
	    <h3><b>Testing Procedure</b></h3>
	    <p class="shifted">
		    We will be adhering to the idea of informed consent by following the guidelines provided by the Belmont Report. As the consent process is analyzed mainly through the three elements Information, Comprehension, and Voluntariness, 
		    these will be utilized during the Participant Observation, Survey, and Interview methodologies to ensure an ethical approach to the testing procedure. Our specific plan is to first provide potential participants a very clear and descriptive
		    explanation of our purpose of the study, list benefits and possible risks involved in their involvement, and explain the exact procedure we will be following through the testing process. Furthermore, we will also let them ask any and all questions
		    they may have before moving on in the consent process. Our next step would be to then provide a document that will again include all of the information spoken about previously to further aid in the comprehension of the study. In this document participants 
		    will be informed that their participation is voluntary, and that they have the right to confidentiality and to withdraw from the study at any time. Team Proct believes that obtaining informed consent is imperative to conducting our study in an ethical manner
		    and we want to be as open to our participants to conduct an honest study.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
		    Our experimental design will follow the traditional research process. After determining our research question, our group will discuss our initial thoughts on how participants may interpret the assets provided to them in the prototype. The study itself will be conducted through observations
		    and interviews. Respectively, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. The participants of this study will be diverse in nature, coming from various demographics and subgroups. This ensures that participants will match our prototype’s user stories. Data will be collected by the researchers
		    through remote access software and screen sharing. The data will then be organized using sheet-based software, such as Excel, as well as recorded in plain text files. The organization of this data will be done through following meaningful naming conventions
			Observations will be conducted during their participation, regarding their actions during certain sections of the prototype. Shared difficulties and similar questions by participants would be noted. Afterward, during the interview stage, we would use open-ended questions to ask participants who fit
		    within various criterias from our user stories of their overall experience during the use of each part of the high-fidelity prototype, the pros and cons of the tool, as well as any lacking aspects in the prototype, or whether the provision of certain assets inhibited an affordance of another. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
		    We will look at the specific commentary of each person and see their subjective reaction to the prototype (some form of descriptive analysis). Most comments from our participants will be constructive in some sort of manner, and if many of the people comment about one aspect of our prototype (whether that be good or bad), it should be noted. To help the process of this analysis, our team would create a list of our software’s functional, nonfunctional, and user experience requirements, and based on the reactions and commentary of the participants, we would check off or mark whichever requirements were not met. Based on whether these requirements were met, we would make changes to the prototype to conform to our requirements further. 
		This type of analysis will show us whether or not the software actually enhances the user’s experience in taking the exam or doesn’t. At the end of the day, we want to know whether our software creates a more smooth test taking experience for users of all backgrounds, and we want to make sure that their experience is as easy (or easier) than taking an in-person exam. We believe the observations we take while a student is taking an exam and the interview questions we ask afterward will help us answer whether their experience was better or worse than a normal exam process or the use of other proctoring software.

	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
		    During a pandemic, in order to test them through surveys, we will email them surveys on a secure link so that we can ensure the security of the survey response so that it will not hinder our experiment. After the receive the email, they will fill it out and submit to which the response will then be 
		    recorded and we will use the results from those surveys. Our second way of testing our prototype is an observational study and during a pandemic in order to prevent any contamination or infection, the studies will be conducted through zoom. We will observe the student using the software live through zoom
		    with our cameras and mics off in order to not disturb the test taker and we will observe what they do. Our third way of testing our prototype is through interviews and during the pandemic, we could either conduct the interview via phone call or video chat.
