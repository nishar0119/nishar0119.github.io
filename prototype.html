	    <h3><b>User Stories</b></h3>
	    
	     <li>1. As a student with color blindness, I want to be able to customize the color and font on my exam screen, so that I am able to properly comprehend the images and information the text conveys.</li>
	    
		    <p class="shifted">
			    In a study conducted by Colour Blind Awareness, 4.5% of the population is colorblind [1]. Because of the smaller number, many designers tend to not be color blind and therefore don’t accommodate this
			    minority population of people. We want to ensure that our proctoring software focuses on these individuals by allowing them to customize the background and font colors/type to their own liking and 
			    what they are comfortable with. In our prototype we provided a section for font specific changes. One of the options we included for the font category was the ability for the student to choose what 
			    font color they would like. The reason we gave color as an option was because research shows that colors can affect the moods of every student differently and a page with color can hold a user’s 
			    attention a lot more than just gray and white colors could [2]. Also, the reason we chose to add the design element of blue hues throughout our website prototype is because many researchers have seen 
			    that blue is a favorite among people with color blindness. Blue and another color, Red, are known as “color blind safe colors” [3].

	    <li>2. As a student with dyslexia, I want to be able to increase the font size and spacing of text questions, so that I am able to navigate the exam at the same level as someone without dyslexia.</li>
	    		
	    		<p class="shifted">
				A study conducted by a group of people from the University of Genoa studied the effects of font sizes and spaces on the efficiency of dyslexic students reading text. The study found that there was 
				significant reduction of the time both dyslexic and non-dyslexic children remained fixated on certain pieces of texts [1]. Based on this study, we wanted to ensure that our proctoring service accommodated 
				any students who may have dyslexia by allowing them to customize the font size and spacing of their exam questions prior to and during an exam. Our current prototype includes a slider under the font 
				sub-category that allows the user to change up how big or small they would like their particular font to be. Research has found that along with reading words, dyslexic students also have trouble “reading 
				names of numbers [2]”. That is why we chose to add the design element of a range slider instead of other methods of choosing a font size. A slider allows a user to easily move back and forth between how large 
				or small their font is, without having to read any number.

	 <li>3. As a student with a visual impairment, I want to be able to customize the contrast and brightness of my screen, so that I do not face any challenges with the visual setup of my exam’s content.</li>
		  <p class="shifted">
			   Research shows that many students with visual impairments generally need questions on the screen presented in high contrast to see everything clearly [1]. Also, depending on each person’s need, they may 
			  need additional or reduced lighting to allow for them to see clearly [2]. Because of these factors, our site allows for a customization of the contrast and brightness of the screen so that students can adjust 
			  the exam software to a way that can benefit them personally. In our prototype, we add the design element Contrast, to allow the user to exercise that ability. Moving the slider allows for the user to build up the 
			  contrast, and we made sure to provide enough range so that users with heavy impairment can have a 7:1 contrast ratio [3].

		<li>4. As a student with ADHD, I want to be able to customize the layout of test questions, so that I can focus on one question at a time, rather than being distracted by the following question text.</li>
	     <p class="shifted">
		     Once a student gets to the setting page, they can click on one of the options on the right side and bring up the contents of that option they chose. As mentioned in the previous wire frames, blue was chosen in order to instill calmness and peace for the user to have a more pleasant test taking experience. In this wire frame, the highlighted selection produces the question spacing selection. This feature allows the user to choose and adjust the spacing of their questions. This page also included a display below that shows an example spacing of the questions and how it would look like when taking an exam.  This feature was created in mind for people with ADHD and other learning disabilities because research shows that proctoring software has a bias towards people with a learning disability because they tend to look off the screen so it unfairly flags them. The students from the Miami University in Ohio stated that Proctorio, the proctoring software they were using was unfairly accusing those with ADHD of cheating due to students looking away from the screen [1]. Tips for teachers for students with ADHD include not having too many questions on one screen or sheet of paper indicating that having a feature that allows the student to change the spacing between questions helps those with ADHD concentrate more [2].

	    <li>5. As a student of color, I want access to the camera brightness and contrast settings, so that during the pre-check process I can avoid being flagged or facing any other issues.</li>
	    <p class="shifted">The settings page is a location that contains a lot of options relevant to the changes we are trying to implement in our proctoring services. The reason why we wanted to implement these features such as webcam contrast is to make sure that people with all skin tones are treated fairly by the proctoring software and won’t get unfairly flagged. According to multiple reports, many students of color are getting unfairly flagged for the color of their skin not being picked up by the camera and thus leading them to get flagged or impeding their test taking experience. As mentioned before, the contrast feature will allow the student to be able to adjust the brightness/contrast of their camera to avoid unfair flagging.

	    <li>8. As a student from a non-english background, I want access to an in-built tool that can translate words for me, so that I am able to comprehend words in the exam context if anything becomes confusing for me.</li>
		    <p class="shifted">
		    </p>
	    
	    <li>9. As an educator, I want to be able to adjust my exam and activate/deactivate certain customizable features, so that my exam is taken where no one student has a clear advantage over another.</li>
	    <p class="shifted">Our entire software revolves around ensuring regular students and students with disabilities (i.e. dyslexia, speech impairment, etc.) have a proper and fair exam environment that will accommodate any one of their needs. However, proctoring software needs to ensure that students have a fair testing environment without giving certain student’s advantages depending on the types of customizations they’re using. For example, if a student is taking a Spanish exam, they shouldn’t be allowed to use the translation feature since it would give them an unfair advantage in the exam. We want to keep the teacher in control since it still is a proctoring software, and the teacher should have the final say in which customizations are allowed and which aren’t for their specific exams. As a result, we put in the “Adjust Student Customizations” feature to allow teachers to have the final say in whether certain customizations are allowed or not allowed for their exams. Another feature we wanted to add was the teacher being able to adjust the exam during the time. For example, if the teacher makes a typo or there’s a specific hint he/she needs to give to the students to help them out, they’re able to do that in the “Adjust Exams” setting.
	    </p>
	      <p class="shifted">This settings screen is the educator’s perspective. Here, we see the “Modify Exam” option selected, and this specific option is what educator can use to adjust parts of the exam. For example, if there’s a specific question that needs adjustment or if there’s a specific hint that needs to be given to the student that would help them solve the problem, this all can be in this window. We needed to make sure that the icons used are easily recognizable so that the user has no confusion on what that specific section in the settings leads to [1]. As a result, we used an icon that had a test paper and pencil to signify the exam. We hope that the icon serves as a proper signifier that this option affords adjusting the exams the teacher has [1]. In this part of the educator’s settings tab, we see the educator selecting for the “Adjust Student Customization” option, and this specific option allows the teacher to adjust the student customization that’s available for a specific exam. For example, if an educator thinks that certain customization options may benefit some students over others, the educator may disable or enable these options. The way the teacher does this is through the lock and unlock buttons on the side of the student’s option. In the first, row of student customizations, we see the lock in a locked state which signifies that this customization affords disabling a certain customization for the student (in this case, the dark mode).

	    <h2>B. Testing Protocol</h2>
	    <br>
	     <h3><b>Research Question and Methodology</b></h3>
	    <p class="shifted">Our research question is to what extent does adding accessibility features to testing software impact a user’s test taking experience? This research question provides us 
		with an ample amount of room to determine what type of effects may result from added features for a user during a proctored exam.
		The testing protocols we have chosen to use to address this research question are interviews and observation.
	    </p>
    
	    <br>
	    <h3><b>Testing Procedure</b></h3>
	    <p class="shifted">
		    We will be adhering to the idea of informed consent by following the guidelines provided by the Belmont Report. As the consent process is analyzed mainly through the three elements Information, Comprehension, and Voluntariness, 
		    these will be utilized during the Participant Observation, Survey, and Interview methodologies to ensure an ethical approach to the testing procedure. Our specific plan is to first provide potential participants a very clear and descriptive
		    explanation of our purpose of the study, list benefits and possible risks involved in their involvement, and explain the exact procedure we will be following through the testing process. Furthermore, we will also let them ask any and all questions
		    they may have before moving on in the consent process. Our next step would be to then provide a document that will again include all of the information spoken about previously to further aid in the comprehension of the study. In this document participants 
		    will be informed that their participation is voluntary, and that they have the right to confidentiality and to withdraw from the study at any time. Team Proct believes that obtaining informed consent is imperative to conducting our study in an ethical manner
		    and we want to be as open to our participants to conduct an honest study.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
		    Our experimental design will follow the traditional research process. After determining our research question, our group will discuss our initial thoughts on how participants may interpret the assets provided to them in the prototype. The study itself will be conducted through observations
		    and interviews. Respectively, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected. The participants of this study will be diverse in nature, coming from various demographics and subgroups. This ensures that participants will match our prototype’s user stories. Data will be collected by the researchers
		    through remote access software and screen sharing. The data will then be organized using sheet-based software, such as Excel, as well as recorded in plain text files. The organization of this data will be done through following meaningful naming conventions
			Observations will be conducted during their participation, regarding their actions during certain sections of the prototype. Shared difficulties and similar questions by participants would be noted. Afterward, during the interview stage, we would use open-ended questions to ask participants who fit
		    within various criterias from our user stories of their overall experience during the use of each part of the high-fidelity prototype, the pros and cons of the tool, as well as any lacking aspects in the prototype, or whether the provision of certain assets inhibited an affordance of another. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
	    </p>
	    
	    <p class="shifted">
		    During a pandemic, in order to test them through surveys, we will email them surveys on a secure link so that we can ensure the security of the survey response so that it will not hinder our experiment. After the receive the email, they will fill it out and submit to which the response will then be 
		    recorded and we will use the results from those surveys. Our second way of testing our prototype is an observational study and during a pandemic in order to prevent any contamination or infection, the studies will be conducted through zoom. We will observe the student using the software live through zoom
		    with our cameras and mics off in order to not disturb the test taker and we will observe what they do. Our third way of testing our prototype is through interviews and during the pandemic, we could either conduct the interview via phone call or video chat.
